# PriceYard Project Status

## Current stage
Stage 11 — Storage Suitability — AUTHORIZED/NOT YET BUILT. Stage 10 is RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved.

## Stage 0 disposition
Owner supplied validation metrics: 65 reached, 14 replies, 5 willing to pay, positive usefulness/trust/continuation signals, sample market records and two source types.

Two Stage 0 claims remain not independently proven as written:
1. The owner explicitly stated the 14-day completion entry was used for form testing and that real completion would need later confirmation.
2. The second source is WhatsApp/live-session intelligence and was described as requiring later independent confirmation.

On 2026-08-12, the owner explicitly granted Application Coding Permission: YES. This remains an owner-approved Stage 0 exception/accepted business risk, not fabricated independent proof.

## Completed and owner-approved stages
- Stage 1 — Project Setup: PASS.
- Stage 2 — Backend Foundation: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after local verification.
- Stage 3 — Database Foundation: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after live Supabase PostgreSQL verification.
- Stage 4 — Authentication: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after local authentication smoke verification.
- Stage 5 — Subscription and 14-Day Trial: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after corrected local runtime smoke verification.
- Stage 6 — Admin Core Management: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after corrected local Supabase-backed smoke verification.
- Stage 7 — Price Updates: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after local Supabase-backed smoke verification.
- Stage 8 — Search, Filters, History, Comparison: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after local Supabase-backed smoke verification and the owner's instruction to continue.
- Stage 9 — Market Signals and Quality Signals: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after local Supabase-backed smoke verification and the owner's instruction to continue.
- Stage 10 — Buying Zones and Sell-Watch Windows: RETESTED/PASS and owner-approved after Alembic migration plus local Supabase-backed owner smoke verification.

## Stage 10 implementation completed
- Added `buying_zones` and `sell_watch_windows` models and approved relationships.
- Added Alembic revision `0002_stage10_buy_sell_watch`.
- Added admin create/edit APIs and full-access view APIs for buying zones and sell-watch windows.
- Buying zones validate price ranges and optional validity dates.
- Buying-zone reason and sell-watch observation reject explicit guarantee/prediction/financial-advice wording.
- Trial and active-paid users can view the full Stage 10 intelligence; free/expired/cancelled users are limited; admin retains full access.
- Feature responses include safety disclaimers that implement the approved “not guaranteed lowest price / not guaranteed profit window” rules.
- No Stage 11 table/API, payment, alert, chart, AI prediction, marketplace, or other future feature was added.

## Stage 10 AI-environment verification
- Python compilation/static schema work: PASS.
- Temporary Alembic migration from the Stage 3 foundation through Stage 10 head: PASS.
- Stage 10 table and required-column inspection: PASS.
- Stage 10 schema/service create/edit/validation checks: PASS.
- Stage 10 FastAPI/API flow against temporary SQLite with a temporary bcrypt test stub: PASS; this is build evidence only.
- Full real-bcrypt/Supabase owner runtime proof is still required on the owner environment.

## Stage 10 owner verification
PASS. Owner applied Alembic revision `0002_stage10_buy_sell_watch` against Supabase PostgreSQL and `docs/evidence/stage-10-owner-smoke.py` ended with `STAGE 10 OWNER SMOKE: PASS`.

## Outstanding project issue
Stage 0 independent-source/duration evidence remains unresolved and must be reconciled before Stage 24 final acceptance.

## Unapproved features added
None.

## Next gate
Stage 11 — Storage Suitability is authorized by the owner's instruction: “if this output is okay, then next.” Build and verify Stage 11 only; do not begin Stage 12 without a new owner approval.
